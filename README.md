This repository contains javascript code for my portfolio website at http://iamriyaz.com
Feel free to fork and play around with it!

## Build
* Clone the repository on your local computer `git clone https://github.com/riyaz-ali/riyaz-ali.github.io.git`
* Install the dependencies `yarn install` (you can also use NPM but I don't maintain a package-lock.json so it may cause some issue)
* For production builds: `yarn run build`
* For development: `yarn run dev`, this will fire up webpack-devserver with Hot module reloading
